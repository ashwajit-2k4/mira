# CMOD Interface PCB

This PCB is designed to work in conjunction with the **TMAG3001 Sensor Array PCB**, forming a complete sensor head system. It serves as the interface between the microcontroller and the sensor array.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Interface the TMAG3001 sensor array with a CMOD FPGA module  
- **CMOD Support**: Two sets of pin headers to securely mount the CMOD  
- **Signal Routing**: All signals are routed via ribbon cable connectors coming from the TMAG3001 Sensor Array PCB  
- **Power Supply**:  
  - Screw terminal block for providing power to both the FPGA and the sensor array  
  - Switches included to control the power supply to different sections

## Features

- **Ribbon Cable Connectors**:  
  - Located on both edges of the PCB  
  - Carry all signal lines from the sensor array PCB  

- **Power Interface**:  
  - Screw terminal for 3.3V/5V input  
  - Power control switches to selectively enable/disable supply to the FPGA and sensor PCB  

- **Mechanical Support**:  
  - Dual header slots to mount a CMOD A7 or similar FPGA board securely
