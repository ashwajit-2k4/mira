# Motor Enclosure

## Purpose

This holds the motor controlling the theta DOF (through the platform) using the 3D printed holder, and the motor bracket to attach the motor for controlling the radial DOF.

##  Description

- **Type:** 3D print
- **Material Suggested:** PLA
- **Approx. Size:** 61mm x 57mm x 71mm

## Assembly Instructions

1. The 3D printed holder at the top allows the motor to be placed directly inside (an adhesive could be used for futher securing it)
2. The motor bracket is placed inside the enclosure, with the two slots fitting in. The motor is then screwed into it.

## Notes

The motors ran very hot, causing some bending in the plastic. A heat sink or a different material might be helpful.
