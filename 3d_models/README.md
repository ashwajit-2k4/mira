# 3D Models

The project consists of several parts listed below. For further details please refer to the individual folders

1. **Large Spacer**: This design is used to hold the PCBs in place, connect to the sensor head and provide a point to attach the acrylic shields to protect the PCBs.

2. **Motor enclosure**: This holds the motor controlling the theta DOF (through the platform) using the 3D printed holder, and the motor bracket to attach the motor for controlling the radial DOF.

3. **Slider**: This part holds the entire z-axis movement mechanism. It slides along the radial direction, moving the entire sensor head, and holds the motor to move in the z direction.

4. **Sensor Head**: This holds the sensor and CMOD PCBs via the large spacer, and is connected to the threaded rod and the support rod controlling the z axis.

5. **CMOD Acrylic Shield**: This attaches to the large spacer and provides an enclosure for the CMOD board.

6. **Sensor PCB Shield**: This acrylic part provides an enclosure for the sensor PCB, and attaches to the large spacer.

7. **Small Spacer**: This part helps provide separation between the PCBs.

8. **Support Rod Holder**: This part simply holds the two horizontal support rods in place, and provides support to the other end of the threaded rod in the r-axis.

9. **Secondary Support Rod Holder**: This part holds only the support rods in place, with space in the middle to allow the motor shaft, coupler and threaded rod the pass through.

10. **Platform**: The object to be characterised is placed on this rotating platform.
